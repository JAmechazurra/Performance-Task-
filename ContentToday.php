				Since the beginning of time, the world has faced countless miserable experiences that became threats to the living beings residing on the planet. If people, and, the world truly wanted to end  

				<br><br> One of those challenges is the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a disease caused by a new coronavirus first identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. Because it is a new virus, scientists are learning more each day. Although most people who have COVID-19 have mild symptoms, COVID-19 can also cause severe illness and even death. Some groups, including older adults and people who've certain underlying medical conditions, are at increased risk of severe diseases. <br><br>

            <font size= "4" face="lato">COVID-19 is a disease that presents on being infected by a deadly coronavirus called the SARS-CoV-2. <br><br>

            This SARS-related virus was first identified in the Chinese city of Wuhan in late 2019. Snakes were originally suspected as a potential source for the outbreak, although some other experts have deemed this unlikely and proposed bats as a reservoir instead. Pangolins have been implicated as a potential link in the transfer chain. <br><br>

            As of April 2020, the search for the animal origin of COVID-19 is ongoing.
            <br><br>

            At the time of writing, numbers of infected are still on the rise, with a mortality rate that varies significantly around the world from less than one to more than 10 percent. <br><br>

            The ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has caused disruptions to economies and social activities througout the world as of year 2020. Treatments and protective therapies are currently in development, with programs expected to begin vaccinations in the US by the start of 2021.<br><br>

               <font size= "4" face="lato">
             -The covid-19 pandemic has dealt a ton of damage on the people's hope and disrupted the ways on how we people live throughout the different parts of the world. The economic and social disruption caused by the pandemic is devastating: tens of millions of people are at risk of falling into extreme poverty, while the number of undernourished people, currently estimated at nearly 690 million, could increase by up to 132 million by the end of the year <br><br>

             -Millions of agricultural workers – waged and self-employed – while feeding the world, regularly face high levels of working poverty, malnutrition and poor health, and suffer from a lack of safety and labour protection as well as other types of abuse. With low and irregular incomes and a lack of social support, many of them are spurred to continue working, often in unsafe conditions, thus exposing themselves and their families to additional risks. <br><br>
             
             -This pandemic will continue affecting the entire food system and has laid bare its fragility. Border closures, trade restrictions and confinement measures have been preventing farmers from accessing markets, including for buying inputs and selling their produce, and agricultural workers from harvesting crops, thus disrupting domestic and international food supply chains and reducing access to healthy, safe and diverse diets. 
             <br><br>
             
             -Decimated jobs and placed millions of livelihoods at risk. As breadwinners lose jobs, fall ill and die, the food security and nutrition of millions of women and men are under threat, with those in low-income countries, particularly the most marginalized populations, which include small-scale farmers and indigenous peoples, being hardest hit.
